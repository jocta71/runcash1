# Fix for 'Cannot access Yo before initialization' error

Changes made:

1. Created RouletteInitializer.ts to ensure Yo variable is initialized before use
2. Created preload.ts to handle importing components in the right order
3. Created global-init.js to initialize global variables
4. Created fix-build.js to automate fixes during build
5. Updated package.json to run the fix script before build
6. Updated vite.config.ts to prioritize loading of initialization files
7. Modified main.tsx to import from the preload module first
8. Updated RouletteCard.tsx to import Yo from RouletteInitializer

These changes ensure that variables are properly initialized before they're referenced, resolving the error during build/runtime.
